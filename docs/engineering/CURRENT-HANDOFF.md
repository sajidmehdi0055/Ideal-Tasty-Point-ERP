# Current Handoff — GOV-001 (Multi-Agent Operating Model Persisted)

Date: 2026-09-18. Branch: docs/multi-agent-operating-model. Base: main (663662e).
Documentation-only governance task: formalized the already-owner-approved Manager-led multi-agent operating model as a permanent repository standard, so future sessions apply it automatically. Application tests/lint/type checks: NOT APPLICABLE (documentation only, no application toolchain touched).

Files created: docs/engineering/MULTI-AGENT-OPERATING-MODEL.md — dynamic agent-count scaling by task size, an extended specialist role catalog (additive to AGENT-ROLES.md's six core roles), the escalation policy (routine-vs-owner-escalation list), the Agent Execution Report format, and the external-tool priority order (Claude Code primary, Codex second for independent review/backup implementation, Google Antigravity third fallback) with an explicit clause that this priority never reduces reviewer independence.

Files modified: AGENTS.md (one new bullet under the top policy referencing dynamic scaling and linking the new doc; one new line in the reference-document list) — no existing guardrail text changed or removed. docs/engineering/AGENT-ROLES.md (one added cross-reference sentence). docs/engineering/CURRENT-HANDOFF.md (this record).

No business requirement, ADR, or existing guardrail was changed. No conflicts found with AGENTS.md or the existing engineering docs (TASK-HANDOFF-PROTOCOL.md, REVIEW-WORKFLOW.md, BRANCHING-AND-REVIEW.md, DEFINITION-OF-DONE.md, AI-CODING-GUARDRAILS.md, AGENT-ROLES.md) — the new document defers to them for independence, handoff, branching, and completion rules rather than restating or altering those rules. Independent review of this documentation-only change is still required before any merge, per REVIEW-WORKFLOW.md's documentation-only applicability clause.

## Next recommended action

Independent documentation review (source fidelity, contradiction, and scope check against AGENTS.md and the linked engineering docs), then owner decision on merge. Do not merge to main without that review and explicit authorization.

## Historical handoff records

### ARCH-001 (Architecture + Security Approved)

Date: 2026-09-17 (updated). Branch: docs/architecture-decision-proposal.
Base revision: 5ed0690 (Merge branch 'docs/inventory-implementation-readiness').
Candidate: five architecture/security documentation files including this handoff; nothing staged. This correction task changes only identity-security-baseline.md and CURRENT-HANDOFF.md.
State: previous independent documentation review FAIL. Three owner-authorized consistency issues corrected and independently re-reviewed: scoped corrections PASS in requirements, architecture and security. Overall baseline consistency FAIL in all three reviews due to remaining outside-scope findings. No implementation authorization.

## Task scope and identities

Owner provided explicit approved architecture decisions (Option B) and a complete identity/security baseline. Root Manager applied these decisions to the relevant documents. The prior review identified wording beyond approved business authority; this correction is limited to the three explicitly authorized findings. No technology installed. No application code written.

Allowed files created (this update):
- docs/decisions/ADR-0005-identity-security-baseline.md
- docs/architecture/identity-security-baseline.md

Allowed files modified (this update):
- docs/decisions/ADR-0004-technical-architecture-proposal.md — status changed from PROPOSAL to APPROVED; all 7 sub-decisions recorded
- docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md — approved stack and security baseline sections added
- docs/engineering/CURRENT-HANDOFF.md — this evidence record

Exclusions: existing approved requirements (inventory-module.md), ADR-0001/0002/0003, root AGENTS.md, README, inventory readiness documents, application code, framework/runtime/database/dependencies. DB/data changes: none. Installs: none. Git staging/commit: not authorized yet.

## Approved decisions summary

### Architecture (ADR-0004 — APPROVED)
- Option B: React (Vite) + Tailwind + PWA / Fastify (Node.js/TypeScript) / PostgreSQL + Redis / REST + OpenAPI + WebSocket
- Deployment: Hybrid (Docker Compose dev/staging + cloud/local production)
- Offline: Critical operations local-first with auto-sync; full offline NOT required
- Multi-branch: Shared PostgreSQL with branch_id tenant separation
- Client: PWA first; native mobile later if genuinely required

### Identity/Security (ADR-0005 — APPROVED)
- Individual accounts; no shared logins; RBAC + per-user overrides
- Branch-scoped access; branch switch re-checks permissions
- JWT with refresh tokens; session/device tracking; lockout controls; optional 2FA for Owners/Admins
- API-level enforcement; least privilege; separation of duties
- Offline: permission cache for operational actions; high-risk actions blocked offline
- Audit trail for sensitive actions; security logs separate from app logs
- No plaintext secrets; separate staff and customer identity scopes

## S-01 blocker status

| Previous blocker | Status now |
|---|---|
| Approved technical architecture | ✅ CLOSED — ADR-0004 approved |
| Identity/security design | ADR-0005 policy approved; scoped corrections PASS; overall consistency FAIL due to remaining findings |
| B-09 permission matrix (S-01 portion) | ⚠️ Low risk — Owner/Manager create/edit settled via INV-11/ADR-0001/ADR-0005. Full matrix (B-09) needed before later slices. |

S-01 readiness is not asserted. Architecture selection remains approved; overall security/documentation consistency has unresolved findings outside this correction scope.

## Checks and risks

Protected files verified unchanged: inventory-module.md, ADR-0001/0002/0003, AGENTS.md, README. Whitespace check: PASS (pre-existing CRLF on ARCHITECTURE.md is not new). Previous independent review: FAIL (baseline_review). Three corrections applied by root Manager: immediate centralized session/token invalidation without expiry delay; action-specific separation of duties with Owner-only archive and OPEN stock-adjustment authority; conditional MAY re-authentication wording. Fresh independent reviews completed on the corrected candidate: requirements_review (requirements), architecture_review (architecture), baseline_review (security). Each returned scoped corrections PASS and overall consistency FAIL. Reviewers made no edits. Remaining findings are recorded below; they are outside the authorized corrections.

Application tests/lint/type checks: NOT APPLICABLE — documentation only; agreed by all three independent reviewers. Local git diff --check passed; tracked requirements and ADR-0001/0002/0003, AGENTS.md and README.md have empty diffs; staging remains empty. This task wrote only identity-security-baseline.md and this handoff; untracked ADRs are not covered by tracked diff evidence. DB/data changes: none. Dependencies: none.

Risks:
- Lockout thresholds, password policy, 2FA method, and permission matrix (B-09) remain open operational/configuration decisions before affected implementation
- Hybrid deployment specifics (provider, server specs, SSL) deferred to implementation
- Customer identity implementation is future scope

## Remaining review findings — outside this correction scope

- Identity baseline RBAC role union and per-user grant/deny precedence are asserted without distinguishing approved policy from proposed design; non-overridable Owner-only and S-01 role restrictions must remain protected.
- Brand-override example assigns an approval workflow while INV-08/D-06 remain open. Admin session-termination authority and future waiter permissions also require traceability to approved authority.
- Waiter identity scope differs between the identity diagram, client table and ADR-0005 wording; do not resolve that scope by assumption.
- ADR-0004 describes auth as stateless without distinguishing token format from required centralized revocation/session enforcement.
- ARCHITECTURE.md still says all architecture content is pending despite the approved stack above.
- ADR-0005's S-01 readiness wording needs reconciliation with unresolved overall consistency findings; approval of the baseline is not evidence that every detailed design statement passed review.

Stock-adjustment approval/authority remains an OPEN BUSINESS DECISION (D-04/B-06/B-09). Broader brand and per-action permissions remain open for their affected capabilities. No new authority, approval workflow or technology was selected in this correction.

## Next recommended action

Fresh reviews completed; report scoped PASS and overall FAIL separately. Wait for owner direction on remaining outside-scope findings and approval before any subsequent staging/commit. Do not stage, commit, merge, push, install or start coding in this task.

Proposed commit message:

```
docs: approve architecture and security baseline (ADR-0004/0005)

- ADR-0004: Option B approved (React/Vite/Fastify/PostgreSQL/Redis/PWA/TypeScript)
- ADR-0005: Identity and security baseline approved
- identity-security-baseline.md: detailed security architecture document
- ARCHITECTURE.md: approved stack and security summary added
- CURRENT-HANDOFF.md: evidence record for architecture approval
```
